**System Context diagram**

This diagram represetns the HighTower ecosystem, that is composed by multiple Systems.
Some of them are simple purposed, other the effort is to pave the way to reuse some funtionallities.

Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape. The focus should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies, protocols and other low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.

**Scope**: The whole ecosystem for HighTower 

**Primary elements**: The system at the moment, is planned to be composed per 3 main systems.
The first one being the [Authorization System](/Authorization%20System/HOME), it main goal like the name suggest is to manage the autorization in a centralized fashion.
Another system is the [Core System](/Core%20System/HOME)., it can vary much but its main goal isn't to serve the users/customers. Its main purpose its provide infrastrutre to other systems can built on top it. E.g. Notification Service; i18N;
The third system is the [Covid Tracker System](/Covid%20Tracker%20System/HOME), this is a SaaS service that provide an platform where Health Service Providers can log/track collected Covid Tests and comunicate them(and their results) to the Central Health Authority.

**Intended audience**: Everybody, both technical and non-technical people, inside and outside of the software development team.
