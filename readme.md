# HugeTower

## Mission
"HugeTower" does not serve any specific commercial purpose; rather, it primarily revolves around personal branding and establishing a core set of guidelines for elements such as templates and frameworks. Its main objective is educational, providing a playground where I can simulate an enterprise environment for experimenting with deployments, new frameworks, and more.

### Name
While not particularly original, the name is inspired by my surname. The origin of my surname is somewhat ambiguous, but based on the Portuguese language, the "-ão" serves as an augmentative suffix, and "Torre" translates to "fortified tower" or "keep." Therefore, I have taken the liberty to assume that at some point in history, the name might have signified "someone from the keep" or "someone stationed at the keeps."

So that was my line of thought.

*`Torrezão`* ⇒ [*"Torreão"*](https://dicionario.priberam.org/torre%C3%A3o), [*"Casa-Torre"*](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_medieval) (pt) [*"Keep"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep) (en)   ⇒ *`Huge Tower`*

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this "venture" is to learn and expand upon existing knowledge. As a software engineer, it's crucial to stay updated on the latest technologies. By creating a simulated "enterprise," I can concentrate on learning while maintaining an environment that closely mimics real-world scenarios within the workforce.

Currently whanting to expand knowlegde in, because one thing is using other is understand who it works:
- [ ] Modeling from an Archetural point of view.
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] Cloud Providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- [ ] Identity Server
- [ ] Message Queueing
- [ ] Document Databases

#### How to get there.
The intention is to operate a collection of "potential" SaaS (Software as a Service) applications on the cloud and oversee their management. 
The term "potential" in this context signifies that the specific type of SaaS may vary, depending on what I learn. It could range from an online store to some form of analytics tool, among other possibilities. 

There is no intention to standardize the use of a single technology across all aspects, such as using SQL Server for all relational databases or caching systems. These technologies are potentially secondary considerations.

### Current SaaS Projects/How i will learn from each of them]
- Identity Server
    - **What it is**: Authorization Service
    - Learning Opportunity:
        - **Framework** Identity Server
        - **Deployment**: Containers
        - **Database** Mongo Db / ~~MySql~~ / ~~SqlServer~~
- Covid Test Tracker System
    - **What it is**: is a tool where a healh service provider company can log/track/manage the Covid Tests that they recoil.
    - Learning Opportunity:
        - **Framework** .net Core WebApi
        - **Deployment**: Containers
        - **Database**:~~Mongo Db~~ / ~~MySql~~ / SqlServer / ~~CockroachDb~~
        - **Cache**: Redis / ~~MemCache~~
        - **Message Broker**: RabbitMq / ~~Kafka~~
- Core Systems
- **What it is**: This is centralized set of service that might be benificial if shared across the multiple projects. Eg. Localization, Notifications
