# HugeTower

## Mission
There is no actual comercial purpose on "HugeTower", its more a question of personal branding and central set of rules in things like (Templates, Frameworks).

The purpose is mainly educational, where I have a playground where i can have a "enterprise enviroment" to play with deployments, new frameworks. Etc

### Name
Althoug not very original the Name is inspired on my surname.
The origin is of my surname is not clear, but based on Portuguese language the "-ão" is augmentative suffixes and "Torre" is "fortified tower, or keep".
So i freely assumed the name somewhere on the history meant "someone from the  
keep, or someone stationed on the keeps"

So that was my line of thought.
