# HugeTower

## Mission
There is no actual comercial purpose on "HugeTower", its more a question of personal branding and central set of rules in things like (Templates, Frameworks).

The purpose is mainly educational, where I have a playground where i can have a "enterprise enviroment" to play with deployments, new frameworks. Etc

### Name
Althoug not very original the Name is inspired on my surname.
The origin is of my surname is not clear, but based on Portuguese language the "-ão" is augmentative suffixes and "Torre" is "fortified tower, or keep".
So i freely assumed the name somewhere on the history, meant "someone from the  
keep, or someone stationed on the keeps"

So that was my line of thought.

*`Torrezão`* ⇒ [*"Torreão"*](https://dicionario.priberam.org/torre%C3%A3o), [*"Casa-Torre"*](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_medieval) (pt) [*"Keep"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep) (en)   ⇒ *`Huge Tower`*

### Purpose
The main purpose of this "venture" is learn/expand existing knowlagde, as a software engineer, i need to keep me up to speed regarding the technologies.
Having a fake "entreprise" allow me to focus on learning always keeping the "ecosystem" as real as possible to the work force.

Currently whanting to expand knowlegde in, because one thing is using other is understand who it works:
- [ ] Modeling from an Archetural point of view.
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] Cloud Providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- [ ] Identity Server
- [ ] Message Queueing
- [ ] Document Databases

#### How to get there.
So, the intention is to have running a set of "potential" SaaS's running on the cloud and manage it.
What is an "potential" SaaS honestly, depends of what i learn. Could be a Online Store or some form of analitics.
There is no intention of uniformize the multiple technolgies, e.g. SQL Server for all of Relational Dbs, or Cache system. Potentially they are a by product.
